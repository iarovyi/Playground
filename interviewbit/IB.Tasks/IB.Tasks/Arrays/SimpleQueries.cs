    /*
     * You are given an array A having N integers.

You have to perform the following steps in a given order.

generate all subarrays of A.
take the maximum element from each subarray of A and insert it into a new array G.
replace every element of G with the product of their divisors mod 1e9 + 7.
sort G in descending order
perform Q queries
In each query, you are given an integer K, where you have to find the Kth element in G.

Note: Your solution will run on multiple test cases so do clear global variables after using them.


Input Format

The first argument given is an Array A, having N integers.
The second argument given is an Array B, where B[i] is the ith query.
Output Format

Return an Array X, where X[i] will have the answer for the ith query.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
1 <= Q <= 1e5
1 <= k <= (N * (N + 1))/2 
For Example

Input:
    A = [1, 2, 4]
    B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output:
    X = [8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 1]
